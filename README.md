## Description
Tic Tac Toe - Everyone knows this game, right? This is one of my projects written in Kotlin. Itâ€™s a simple two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with "X" or "O". The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins!

This project showcases my skills in Kotlin programming, including logic implementation, user input handling, and basic UI.

## Features
- Two-player gameplay
- Simple and intuitive design
- Win detection for rows, columns, and diagonals
- Reset game option
